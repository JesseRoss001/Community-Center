# Testing

## Responsiveness

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 START OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site on various device sizes.

The minimum requirement is for the following 3 tests:
- Mobile
- Tablet
- Desktop

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the tested responsiveness, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

Using the "amiresponsive" mockup image (or similar) does not suffice the requirements.
Consider using some of the built-in device sizes in the Developer Tools.

If you have tested the project on your actual mobile phone or tablet, consider also including screenshots of these as well.
It showcases a higher level of manual tests, and can be seen as a positive inclusion!

Sample responsiveness testing documentation:

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 END OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

I've tested my deployed project on multiple devices to check for responsiveness issues.

## Lighthouse Audit

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 START OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site's Lighthouse Audit reports.
Avoid testing the local version (especially if developing in Gitpod), as this can have knock-on effects of performance.

If you don't have Lighthouse in your Developer Tools,
it can be added as an [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk).

Don't just test the home page (unless it's a single-page application).
Make sure to test the Lighthouse Audit results for all of your pages.

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the results, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

Sample Lighthouse testing documentation:

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 END OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues.

| Page | Mobile | Desktop | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse-home-mobile.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse-home-desktop.png) | Some minor warnings |
| About | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse-about-mobile.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse-about-desktop.png) | Some minor warnings |
| Gallery | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse-gallery-mobile.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse-gallery-desktop.png) | Slow response time due to large images |

## Defensive Programming

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 START OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

Defensive programming (defensive design) is extremely important!

When building projects that accept user inputs or forms, you should always test the level of security for each.
Examples of this could include (not limited to):

Forms:
- Users cannot submit an empty form
- Users must enter valid email addresses

PP3 (Python-only):
- Users must enter a valid letter/word/string when prompted
- Users must choose from a specific list only

MS3 (Flask) | MS4/PP4/PP5 (Django):
- Users cannot brute-force a URL to navigate to a restricted page
- Users cannot perform CRUD functionality while logged-out
- User-A should not be able to manipulate data belonging to User-B, or vice versa
- Non-Authenticated users should not be able to access pages that require authentication
- Standard users should not be able to access pages intended for superusers


🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 START OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

Another way of performing defensive testing is a simple Pass/Fail for each test.
The assessors prefer the above method, with the full test explained, but this is also acceptable in most cases.

When in doubt, use the above method instead, and delete the table below.

## User Story Testing

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 START OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

Testing user stories is actually quite simple, once you've already got the stories defined on your README.

Most of your project's **features** should already align with the **user stories**,
so this should as simple as creating a table with the user story, matching with the re-used screenshot
from the respective feature.

Use this section to list any known issues you ran into while writing your Jest tests.
Remember to include screenshots (where possible), and a solution to the issue (if known).

This can be used for both "fixed" and "unresolved" issues.

### Python (Unit Testing)

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 START OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

Adjust the code below (file names, etc.) to match your own project files/folders.

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 END OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

I have used Django's built-in unit testing framework to test the application functionality.

In order to run the tests, I ran the following command in the terminal each time:

`python3 manage.py test name-of-app `

To create the coverage report, I would then run the following commands:

`coverage run --source=name-of-app manage.py test`

`coverage report`

To see the HTML version of the reports, and find out whether some pieces of code were missing, I ran the following commands:

`coverage html`

`python3 -m http.server`

Below are the results from the various apps on my application that I've tested:

| App | File | Coverage | Screenshot |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bag | test_forms.py | 99% | ![screenshot](documentation/py-test-bag-forms.png) |

#### Unit Test Issues


🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 START OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed.
This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used.
Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding
implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

If you've identified any unfixed bugs, no matter how small, be sure to list them here.
It's better to be honest and list them, because if it's not documented and an assessor finds the issue,
they need to know whether or not you're aware of them as well, and why you've not corrected/fixed them.

Some examples:

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 END OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

- On devices smaller than 375px, the page starts to have `overflow-x` scrolling.

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug01.png)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to add additional media queries to handle this, but things started becoming too small to read.

- For PP3, when using a helper `clear()` function, any text above the height of the terminal does not clear, and remains when you scroll up.

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug02.png)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to adjust the terminal size, but it only resizes the actual terminal, not the allowable area for text.

- When validating HTML with a semantic `section` element, the validator warns about lacking a header `h2-h6`. This is acceptable.

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug03.png)

    - Attempted fix: this is a known warning and acceptable, and my section doesn't require a header since it's dynamically added via JS.

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 START OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

If you legitimately cannot find any unfixed bugs or warnings, then use the following sentence:

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 END OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of.
