**** HTML CHECKER 
Base.html 

Parse Errors for Django Template Tags: The checker points out parse errors for lines where you use Django template tags, such as {% extends 'community/base.html' %}, {% load static %}, {% block content %}, and so on. These tags are not standard HTML and will not be recognized by a generic HTML validator.

Use of Django Template Variables: Similarly, the checker flags lines where you use Django template variables like {{ user.profile }}. These are Django-specific and won't be understood by a standard HTML checker.

Meta Tags and Links: The checker doesn't seem to recognize the {% block title %} and {% endblock title %} syntax used in your <title> tag, which is a Django template feature. This might be why it's reporting an issue with the <title> tag.

CSS and JavaScript Loading: The checker doesn't understand the {% static 'styles/style.css' %} syntax used to load static CSS files. Again, this is specific to Django and not standard HTML.

Conditionals and Loops: The checker may flag constructs like {% if ... %} and {% for ... %} because they are not part of standard HTML.
